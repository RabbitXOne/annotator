# ðŸ“’ Annotator

The Annotator extension is the perfect tool for adding annotations and personal notes to websites. It's invaluable for conducting in-depth research for projects, essays, articles, and other tasks. This extension makes organizing your information significantly easier.

How does it work? Simply highlight the text you want to annotate, right-click, and choose the annotation option from the context menu. Your highlighted text will appear highlighted. Click on it to open a window where you can add your note and change the highlight color.

The popup menu displays all annotations on the current page. You'll find a button that leads to a full page view of all your annotations, where they can be edited. Additionally, there's a feature that opens a new tab and scrolls directly to a selected annotation.

All data is stored locally on your device. It is never sent to the developer or any other person or company.
